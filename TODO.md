* help menu in the left hand menu
* planning a meeting to discuss the conclusion and loose ends

* the revert is a hyperlink, but is not visible as such.
* and when I confirm the 'revert' at first it seems as if all the boxes but one have disappeared. Only when I refresh the page everything is as it should
* perhaps it's useful to have the version that is set on the 'current' framed in a colour? Because when you have reverted and accepted an earlier version, and you then open the history again, you can't really tell which version you're in.
* there was an earlier question about the possibility to copy-paste an entire page, instead of just one box, in order to make several versions of the same page. Or can this by done by giving the page another title in the right column, and then in the back-end by changing the name of the page there?
